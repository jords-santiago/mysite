        <p>
          In a world full of whys, say "why not?". In a world full of "can't",
          say "can do". In a world full of problems, we might as well solve them.
          I am currently looking for opportunities in Research and Development
          and Software Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>Up until its site closure, I worked as Software Developer at
          Nokia Manila Technology Center with a position of Senior Specialist.
          I maintained a test tool software used for performance testing of
          Nokia's controller products. I also had a role of Fault Coordinator
          where I monitored reported bugs.
        </p>
        <p>Before that, I was previously a Senior Hardware Engineer at Canon
          Information Technologies Philippines, Inc. where I worked as a Design
          Verification Engineer. I had experience as a Configuration Management
          Lead, Quality Assurance Lead and Technical Lead in the various
          projects that I have been a part of.
        </p>
        <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications
          Engineering from the University of the Philippines. The education and
          experience I had there got me started in problem solving and
          critical/creative thinking, skills that I still use to this day.
